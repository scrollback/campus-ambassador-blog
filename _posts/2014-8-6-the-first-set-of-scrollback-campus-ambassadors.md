title: The first set of Scrollback Campus Ambassadors
---

Selection is always a tougher process for the selector than the applicants. The Scrollback team also had to spend a few sleepless nights to go through all the applications, listen to the applicants during the meetings in the Scrollback room and finally selecting the best from the bunch. We would love to have accommodated all of the applicants, but since we are a small team here, mentoring them would be difficult from our end and thus, we had to put some applicants in queue for the next term.

All the selected candidates have already been informed via email. So, if you have received your email already, here is a more descriptive information on all of the tasks that you are expected to be performing over the next few months as a Scrollback Campus Ambassador:

* Creating and maintaining at least one active Scrollback room (community) per college. [This is definitely not supposed to be a room for the Scrollback Campus Ambassador.] These rooms are expected to be for your college, where all intra-campus conversations can happen. You can own multiple rooms (one per course or for their other communities). This task is going to be compulsory for everyone. 

<small>[Active might not mean the same for everyone, and we leave it on to you to decide what can be called as an active room. A room with 500 members can be called active or a room with fewer participants but more communications might also be called active.]</small>
    
* Make one blog post every month about your experience with Scrollback and work as a Campus Ambassador. Your blogs need not be event updates only. You can go ahead and blog about some incidence where you had a tough experience explaining Scrollback to your fellow batchmate etc. Your blogs can also be on the different technologies that builds Scrollback and ways in which you think Scrollback can be made better. These blogs will play a major role in selecting the ‘Campus Ambassador of the month’. This is also going to be a mandatory task for every Campus Ambassador.

###The list of optional tasks:

* **Graphics work:**
	* Help us create some cool Scrollback Campus Ambassador posters which can be used across all events this season.
	* Help us create some cool Facebook cover pics, digital posters, cool logos etc for Scrollback Campus Ambassador. 
    <br><br>
* **Writing work:**
Actively writing blog posts about feature(s) of Scrollback which you like best or about your experiences with Scrollback. These will not be same as the one compulsory blog post that every Campus Ambassador will need to write once a month. If you take up this task, you will be expected to make more blog posts than just one a month. You need not be an awesome blogger with great skills to do this. You will be assigned someone from the Scrollback team to do a regular proofreading and editing of your blog before they are shared.
 If your blogs are appreciated by our team, we can post them on the official Scrollback blog. Even if you have something very specific to say for which you would like to use the official Scrollback blog, you can be given the access (depending on the requirement).
 
* **PR and marketing**:
Actively promote Scrollback on all social media platform. Making regular posts on Facebook, twitter etc. This is a very crucial role. You need to understand the product well before making any public comment about it on any social media. You will be assigned some mentor from the Scrollback team to check your content before you post them (if you are unsure about them).

* **Coding**:
If you are particularly interested in contributing to the codebase of Scrollback, checkout the github repository of Scrollback and then we can get you in touch with any of our in-house developers to mentor and guide you. 

* **Community Leader**:
If you think you have sufficient leadership capabilities, sign up to be the community leader of your region. 
Eg. Kolkata can have a community leader of its own. Bangalore can have one or more community leaders here in Bangalore.
Community leaders will be directly responsible for all communications among all the Scrollback groups they are leading. Those leaders will be our first point of contact for any updates about the communities they will be leading. 
This is a very crucial role. Always remember the great saying that with great power comes great responsibility. Just like we all like to be called “leaders”, the package bring along many very crucial responsibilities.


###Other things you can do as a Scrollback Campus Ambassador:
Organize Scrollback events in and around your college. These events need not talk only about Scrollback, Scrollback can be a part of these events. These can be generic Open Source events like a Wikipedia or Mozilla event whose one part can be Scrollback. All resources for this, including slides or even official Scrollback spokes person for the event can be arranged (if informed on time).

It is important for every Campus Ambassador to keep hanging around the [Campus Ambassador room on Scrollback](https://scrollback.io/campus-ambassador) and help us know about your progress with your work.
