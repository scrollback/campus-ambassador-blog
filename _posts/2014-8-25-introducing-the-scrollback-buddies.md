###The Scrollback buddies:

####Who are they?
Scrollback buddies are enthusiastic community builders, working hand in hand with the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors, leading campaigns at their colleges and within their communities to encourage others to use Scrollback as well as contribute to this Open Source project. 

####How are they different from Scrollback Campus Ambassadors?
Scrollback buddies will be directly working with the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors, being their mentees and learning from them. They will also be recruited in the Scrollback Campus Ambassador programme by an existing Scrollback Campus Ambassador. Every Scrollback buddy will need to be referred by an existing Scrollback Campus Ambassador to begin their contribution to Scrollback.

####How will they sign up?
Registration forms will be available for all candidates who would like to be Scrollback buddies. The name of the Scrollback Campus Ambassador, who is referring or vouching for that buddy needs to be included in the form. 
Once we get your request, we will leave it to the mentioned Scrollback Campus Ambassadors to decide whether the buddy should be allowed into the program or not. 

####How will a Scrollback buddy become a Scrollback Campus Ambassador?
There is no direct registration process for Scrollback Campus Ambassadors any more. Only the Scrollback buddies can grow up to be a Scrollback Campus Ambassador.

After a series of contribution, when at least 2 Scrollback Campus Ambassadors vouch for a Scrollback buddy to be promoted as a Scrollback Campus Ambassador, the buddy directly raises in position and becomes a Scrollback Campus Ambassador.
While vouching, every Scrollback Campus Ambassador will need to state all the reasons for vouching along with all links of relevant works of the Scrollback buddy.

Buddies are also expected to execute the same task as allocated to the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors. There will be different defined criteria for earning those badges. Once a Scrollback Campus Ambassador has earned atleast 10 badges (same or different), he or she will be eligible to apply for being a Scrollback Campus Ambassador. 


####What is considered as ‘relevant work’ for Scrollback buddies?
Scrollback buddies can execute the same set of [tasks as allocated for the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors](http://blog.scrollback.io/the-first-set-of-scrollback-campus-ambassadors/). The reward system for the Scrollback buddies will also remain same as that of the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors.
