* **Writing work:** Actively writing blog posts about feature(s) of Scrollback which you like best or about your experiences with Scrollback. These will not be same as the one compulsory blog post that every Campus Ambassador will need to write once a month. If you take up this task, you will be expected to make more blog posts than just one a month. You need not be an awesome blogger with great skills to do this. You will be assigned someone from the Scrollback team to do a regular proofreading and editing of your blog before they are shared.
If your blogs are appreciated by our team, we can post them on the official Scrollback blog. Even if you have something very specific to say for which you would like to use the official Scrollback blog, you can be given the access (depending on the requirement).

Share all your blog posts here:

* **PR and marketing:** Actively promote Scrollback on all social media platform. Making regular posts on Facebook, twitter etc. This is a very crucial role. You need to understand the product well before making any public comment about it on any social media. You will be assigned some mentor from the Scrollback team to check your content before you post them (if you are unsure about them).

* **Coding:** If you are particularly interested in contributing to the codebase of Scrollback, checkout the github repository of Scrollback and then we can get you in touch with any of our in-house developers to mentor and guide you.

* **Organizing Scrollback events in your college or community:** Organize Scrollback events in and around your college. These events need not talk only about Scrollback, Scrollback can be a part of these events. These can be generic Open Source events like a Wikipedia or Mozilla event whose one part can be Scrollback. All resources for this, including slides or even official Scrollback spokesperson for the event can be arranged (if informed on time).
