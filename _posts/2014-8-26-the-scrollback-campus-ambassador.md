title: The Scrollback Campus Ambassador - an elevator programme
---

The Scrollback Campus Ambassador programme, or the Scrollback elevator programme as we call it, is designed to help you grow from being new contributors to finally being a part of the Scrollback core team.

To help you elevate in your journey as a Scrollback contributor, we have tried to recognize a few contribution pathways and ways of rewarding each contribution so as to help you reach the next level easily, gaining more responsibilities as well as more privileges.

Level 1 - **Scrollback buddies:**
To join the Scrollback Campus Ambassador programme, you will need to begin your journey as a Scrollback buddy. To know more about who Scrollback buddies are and how to be a Scrollback buddy, you can [refer to the following document](http://blog.scrollback.io/introducing-the-scrollback-buddies/).

The Scrollback buddies will be mentored by the existing Scrollback Campus Ambassadors who will guide them to take their first steps and make their first contributions to Scrollback.

The different things that a Scrollback buddy can do are:

* Scrollback buddies can host Scrollback events or use Scrollback for other events. They will need to make blog posts of their events along with relevant photographs.
* Scrollback buddies can assist Scrollback Campus Ambassadors for an event. For that as well, they will be expected to make blog posts along with relevant photographs.
* Scrollback buddies can contribute to the Scrollback code base. In that case, every pull request that is accepted will be counted as one relevant work.
* Scrollback buddies can do social media marketing by making posts about Scrollback on facebook or tweeting about them or making blog posts about Scrollback, its features and technologies behind it.

Level 2 - **Scrollback Campus Ambassadors (SCA):**
Scrollback buddies will grow to become Scrollback Campus Ambassadors. To know more about Scrollback Campus Ambassadors, [you can refer to the following document](http://blog.scrollback.io/scrollback-campus-ambassador/).

The SCAs will be responsible for recruiting new Scrollback buddies and mentoring their buddies to make their different contributions to Scrollback. The SCAs will also have the superpower to promote a Scrollback buddy to the position of Scrollback Campus Ambassador by vouching for them against their work. (Every vouch will need to be reasoned and supported by links of relevant work done by the buddy).

The other contribution pathways for a Scrollback Campus Ambassadors are documented [here](http://blog.scrollback.io/the-first-set-of-scrollback-campus-ambassadors/).

Level 3 - **Scrollback Mentors:**
Every Scrollback Campus Ambassador will be rewarded badges against their contribution. There will be different defined criteria for earning those badges. Once a Scrollback Campus Ambassador has earned atleast 10 badges (same or different), he or she will be eligible to apply for being a Scrollback mentor. 

Scrollback mentors will be people directly working with the Scrollback team. They will have access to the Scrollback office and all other infrastructure which is accessible to Scrollback employees. They will also be included in all major decision makings regarding the further enhancement of the Scrollback Campus Ambassador programme or the Scrollback project in general. These group of people will also be Scrollbackâ€™s first preference for any internship or full time employee opportunities in Scrollback.


Level 4 - **Scrollback Leaders:**
All Scrollback mentors will be eligible to become a Scrollback leader for a tenure of 1 year. There can be only one Scrollback leader per city in India unless there are too many Scrollbackers in some city where we might decide to appoint more than one leader. 

Scrollback mentors can nominate themselves to be a Scrollback leader. Based on their contribution and activity, they will be selected as the Scrollback leader. If there are more than one eligible nominations from the same city, all Scrollback Campus Ambassadors and mentors from that city will decide on the leader through the process of voting.

Scrollback leaders will have all the privileges as that of the Scrollback mentor. Other than the normal tasks, a Scrollback leader will also have the following responsibilities:

* A Scrollback leader will decide and promote a Scrollback buddy to the position of a Scrollback Campus Ambassador.
* A Scrollback leader will have to take care of all the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors as well as buddies who are working under them. Help them organize events, make their contributions and also promote them to the next level.
* All budget and swag approvals will need to be vouched by the Scrollback Leader of that region before being processed from the Scrollback office.


We, the Scrollback team, would like to create more opportunities for our Scrollback Campus Ambassadors to grow into community leaders. We are striving everyday to find more ways of helping and benefiting all our Scrollbackers.
