title: Scrollback Campus Ambassador of the month - September
---

Join us in congratulating our rockstar, Mrinal Jain, the Scrollback Campus Ambassador of the month for September.

Bhopal has officially hosted the maximum number of Scrollback events till date, initiated and executed by Mrinal and his team. Mrinal is the only Scrollback Campus Ambassador to have recruited 17 new buddies for the program in the time span of less than 2 months.

According to Mrinal, the students at Sanghvi Institute of Management and Science love Scrollback because its the only chat app that is allowed by colleges on campus. Not only is Scrollback a rage among students but the administration finds it useful too.

We would also like to acknowledge Rahul Taleja, Mrinalâ€™s buddy at the campus ambassador program.  He deserves a special mention for his leadership and contribution to the program through organizing events, talks and participation in Scrollback conversations.

Thank you Mrinal and Rahul for all your good work and we hope to see you cross many more milestones with Scrollback and beyond!
