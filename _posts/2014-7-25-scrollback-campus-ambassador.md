###Who we Are?
Scrollback Campus Ambassadors are leaders, who are enthusiastic community builders, leading campaigns at their colleges and within their communities to encourage others to use Scrollback as well as contribute to this Open Source project. 

###What we Do?
* Create (and maintain) Scrollback rooms for our respective colleges (or courses).
* Create (and maintain) an active online community against our created Scrollback rooms.
* Promote Scrollback within our colleges and communities and encourage others to create their own online communities using Scrollback.
* Plan and host fun events in our college. We can even request some members of the Scrollback team to come down and be a part of our events in our campus.
* Grow the Scrollback community as a whole and be an active member of the Scrollback ecosystem.

###How do we do it?
* The selected Campus Ambassadors will be mentored (both online as well as offline) by the core team members of the Scrollback community to use Scrollback and also help others to use Scrollback.
* The Ambassadors will have an [online meeting](https://scrollback.io/campus-ambassador) every alternate week, to give an update on the status of their work.
* Each candidate will be expected to make regular blog posts of their activities and report their on-going tasks to their mentors on a daily basis. Based on their monthly reports, one ambassador will be selected each month to be the **“Ambassador of the month”**. That person will not only be featured on the Scrollback official blog, but will also receive some special rewards against his (or her) great work.

###Whats in it for me?
At college level, we rarely get opportunities of working on live projects. All we end up doing is, learning loads of theory and implementing them in small (personal) projects. Only an Open Source organization like Scrollback can give you the platform to work on live projects with experienced developers from across the globe.

Even if you are not very interested in technical development, being a part of a global community, gives you the ultimate platform to network with other fellow mates of your interest domain.

Most importantly, if you are a believer of openness in technology and freedom to be able to use them (without needing to pay for them), joining the Scrollback community can be your step closer to the global community of Free and Open Source Software lovers.

####Other benefits of joining
* The selected Campus Ambassadors will be the official Scrollback evangelists in their respective colleges.
* Each Campus Ambassador will be the proud owner of an official Scrollback T-shirt. Every month, one Campus Ambassador will be chosen as the “Ambassador of the month” and will be featured on the official blog of Scrollback. All super active campus ambassadors will be awarded super cool rewards.
* If our Campus Ambassadors have something to say, the official Scrollback blog can be their platform.
* Being a part of Scrollback, each Campus Ambassador will be promoting the open web and gain marketing experience.
* Some of the Scrollback Campus Ambassadors might also receive opportunities of doing internships with Scrollback.
* Being a part of the Scrollback ecosystem, you will have access to a network of all Campus Ambassadors across the globe.
* On completion of the programme, each Campus Ambassador will be awarded a certificate or letter of recommendation.
