title: Scrollback Campus Ambassador of the month - August

A huge round of applause for all our Scrollback Campus Ambassadors who has been super awesome in the last one month. From installing Scrollback and working with the codebase, to making fabulous T-shirt designs, writing some great blogposts about the programme; they have done loads of amazing work.

But since we are bound to choose one winner, we decided to choose the extra-awesome one in the group!

A big shout out for our first Scrollback Campus Ambassador of the month, [Gautam Sharma](scrollbacklovers.blogspot.in).

Gautam, our Scrollback Campus Ambassador from Gwalior, has proved himself to be a fabulous leader. He has successfully hosted the first Scrollback Campus Ambassador event in his college on the 30th of August, resulting in the recruitment of a huge number of new buddies in the Scrollback community.

Gautam is also a great blogger who has been actively blogging about Scrollback from the very commencement of the programme. Gautam says - "I have been associated with many campus ambassador program but the sense of professionalism I have seen in this program I have never seen before."

We thank him for all the great work and wish him all the best for his future endeavours in the programme.
